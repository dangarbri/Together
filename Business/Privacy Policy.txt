This is a simple privacy policy because we are doing our best to limit what information we keep.

The app works by uploading your content to our server, where we then send it forward to your
partner. Once we've verified your partner has received the message, it is deleted from our server.
All content that you create within the app is stored only on your device and may be erased by you
in case the app begins to use too much space.

We store your Name and email address in order to identify you. And we store statistical data
based on your usage in order to improve the app.

Statistical data includes (And this will eventually be information you can see in the app):
   - # of messages sent & received (I repeat, we do not save your messages any longer than needed to ensure delivery)
   - That's all I have in mind right now, so update this if it ever changes.

We do not share any of this information with any third parties. It is only used for displaying to you
for fun, and for us to understand how you use our app so that we may improve it.


---------------DISCLAIMER-------------------------
Prototype will not use android push notifications... So this means it will probably cause battery drain
by polling the server periodically. Privacy policy will have to change when we're forced to give all your
data to Google in order to support push notifications...

terms of use are here... But I can't read the legaleze...
